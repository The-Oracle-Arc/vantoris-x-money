# Vantoris X Money

Vantoris member app with the X Money-inspired member UI, Base44-backed application services, and a separated operations workspace.

- Repository: https://github.com/iamtheoracle/vantoris-x-money
- Recovery branch: `recovery/merge-vantoris-live`
- Recovery pull request: https://github.com/iamtheoracle/vantoris-x-money/pull/2

## Recovery status

This branch restores the original application entry point, route definitions, authentication context, Base44 client, member and operations screens, shared UI primitives, and the private LLM gateway/proxy files from `The-Oracle-Arc/vantoris-live`.

**This is still a recovery-in-progress branch, not a production release.** The source repository contains substantially more files than have been restored so far. Remaining shared components, Base44 entity/function/workflow definitions, and other supporting modules still need to be recovered and audited. Original source contains no standalone raster card-image assets in its Git tree; visual assets appear to be implemented through components/styles or external references, which should be verified during UI QA.

## Safety and release rules

- Do not merge or deploy until the build, route coverage, authentication and authorization boundaries, backend integrations, and AI gateway have been verified.
- Do not enter live member credentials or payment details into an unverified deployment.
- The recovery UI and code do not establish that any bank, payment processor, or settlement integration is live.
- Never force-push over `main`. Recover through the reviewable pull request and preserve the existing branch history.
- Keep all provider/API secrets server-side in deployment environment variables; never commit secrets to the repository.

## Validation

A GitHub Actions build workflow is included at `.github/workflows/recovery-build.yml`. Check the pull request's latest workflow run for the current build result. A successful compile alone is not a substitute for security review, integration testing, or end-to-end browser QA.
